## Custom widgets 

InstantSearch.js comes bundled with a set of 18 UI components. Each of them
has options to manipulate CSS classes or even modifying part of the HTML
output (templates).

However, those may not be enough for your use-case or you might want
to use parameters from that are not usable in the current set of widgets.

That's what this guide is all about: extending instantsearch.js to fit your
needs perfectly.

InstantSearch.js offers two ways for building new widgets:
 - use connectors to reuse the business logic of an existing widget
 - use the widget specification to interact directly with Algolia

## Connectors

2 examples:
 - making a menu with a dropdown
 - adding items to the hits


## AddWidget()
